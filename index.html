    <h3>Highlights from our recent trip ✈️</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
      This past spring break we flew out to Arizona to visit family and explore
      as many sites as we could during the few days we had there. The place that
      really stood out to me and I can't wait to get back to is Sedona, Arizona.
    </p>

    <h3>What made Sedona so great</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The landscape! The red rock formations were amazing.</li>
      <li>Trails</li>
      <li>Pink Jeep Tour was so fun for the whole family</li>
      <li>Ate at some great restaurants</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The second day that we were there, it rained the whole time. Determined to
      not let that keep us from exploring, one of the places we visited was the

      It was a great place to stop at when wanting to stay out of the rain.
      There were some interactive activities <br />
      that my kids enjoyed and where it was located, great views.
